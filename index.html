    <small>OUR APPROACH</small>
    <h1><b>Customer Discovery Playbook</b></h1>
    In our many years of experience designing and building products, we‚Äôve <br>
    learned how important it is to regularly ask, ‚ÄúIs this the right thing for us to <br>
    be building right now?‚Äù A key ingredient in building that right thing is <br>
    knowing who you're building it for and why they need it right now. This <br>
    collection of customer discovery exercises will help your team find (or <br>
    regain) customer, product, and strategic focus. <br>
